## Internal Linking Strategy

### Link Architecture

**Objective:** Create topical clusters with locations as subcategories

```
Home
├── Services (Pillar Page)
│   ├── Lawn Mowing (Service Page)
│   │   ├── Lawn Mowing in St. Matthews (Location Page)
│   │   ├── Lawn Mowing in Highlands (Location Page)
│   │   └── Lawn Mowing in [Others] (Location Pages)
│   ├── Edging (Service Page)
│   │   ├── Edging in St. Matthews (Location Page)
│   │   └── [Others]
│   └── [More Services]
├── Areas (Location Hub)
│   ├── St. Matthews (Location Hub - Category Page)
│   │   ├── Services in St. Matthews
│   │   └── Reviews in St. Matthews
│   ├── Highlands (Location Hub)
│   └── [More Neighborhoods]
└── About
```

### Linking Strategies

**Strategy 1: Service → Location**
From each service page, link to location pages offering that service:
```
"Serving [Service Name] in St. Matthews, Highlands, Jeffersontown, and more"
→ Link each neighborhood to its location page
```

**Strategy 2: Location Hub Pages**
Create a hub page for each neighborhood (advanced):
- `/areas/st-matthews/` - main location page
- `/areas/st-matthews/lawn-mowing/` - service-specific page
- `/areas/st-matthews/gallery/` - area-specific portfolio
- `/areas/st-matthews/reviews/` - area-specific reviews

**Strategy 3: Location → Related Locations**
Link similar neighborhoods:
- In St. Matthews page, link to nearby Highlands
- In Highlands page, link to nearby St. Matthews and Jeffersontown
- In Jeffersontown page, link to nearby Anchorage and Lyndon

**Strategy 4: Location → Service**
Each location page should link to detailed service pages:
```
"Learn more about our [Service Name] services"
→ Link to /services/[service-slug]/
```

**Strategy 5: Hub Linkage**
Create an `/areas/` hub page linking to all location pages:
```
/areas/ (Hub)
├── Browse all service areas
├── Links to all location pages
├── Service area map
└── Area statistics
```

### Link Text Guidelines

**Primary Keyword Anchor Text (5-10%):**
- "Lawn mowing in St. Matthews"
- "Landscaping services in Highlands"
- "Lawn care in Jeffersontown"

**Branded Anchor Text (30-40%):**
- "Aaron's Lawn Care in St. Matthews"
- "Our St. Matthews service area"

**Navigational (30-40%):**
- "Service areas"
- "View all neighborhoods"
- "More service locations"

**Long-tail/Descriptive (10-20%):**
- "Find local lawn care near you"
- "Professional landscaping in your area"

### Internal Link Distribution

**Per Location Page:**
- 3-5 outgoing links to service pages
- 2-3 outgoing links to related location pages
- 1-2 outgoing links to hub pages
- 1 outgoing link to home/about (footer)

**Total:** 7-11 internal links per location page
