### LOCAL CONTEXT SECTION

## About St. Matthews, Louisville

St. Matthews is one of Louisville's most desirable communities, known for its affluent residential neighborhoods, mature landscaping, and family-friendly atmosphere. The neighborhood is home to approximately 18,000 residents and features a mix of executive homes, established estates, and well-maintained properties.

### Key St. Matthews Features

- Located approximately 8 miles east of downtown Louisville
- Primary ZIP code: 40207 (with portions of 40205)
- Notable landmarks: St. Matthew's Mall, Watterson Park, Westport Village
- Nearby attractions: Eastpoint Nature Preserve, Seneca Park, local dining and retail
- Community center: St. Matthews Recreation Center
- Excellent schools: Distinction in both public and private education options

### St. Matthews Residential Character

St. Matthews properties range from classic colonial estates to modern contemporary homes, with mature landscaping being a defining feature. Many properties feature established trees, foundation plantings, and mature lawns that have been cultivated for decades. These mature landscapes require specialized care to maintain their beauty and health.

### Seasonal Considerations for St. Matthews

Maintaining a beautiful lawn in St. Matthews requires attention to the area's specific seasonal patterns:

**Spring (March-May):** Spring brings rapid grass and plant growth. Winter debris must be removed, mulch refreshed, and early-season pruning completed. Your St. Matthews lawn will need mowing more frequently as growth accelerates.

**Summer (June-August):** Summer heat and occasional drought stress require consistent mowing schedules and supplemental watering. We adjust mowing frequency based on growth rates and weather patterns.

**Fall (September-November):** Fall is critical in St. Matthews. Mature trees drop significant leaf volume that must be efficiently removed. Beds are prepared for dormancy, plants are cut back, and the property is winterized.

**Winter (December-February):** Winter snow removal and de-icing keep driveways safe. Dormant season maintenance includes minor pruning and winterization tasks.

### Aaron's Commitment to St. Matthews

Aaron's Lawn Care is deeply committed to being an active part of the St. Matthews community. We sponsor local youth sports programs, maintain partnerships with St. Matthews businesses, and take pride in serving our neighbors.
